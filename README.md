Hello, It's basically a app for cricket lovers where you can see live scores and stats of players.😍

I used a API named cricapi.(Link - https://rapidapi.com/cricketapilive/api/cricbuzz-cricket/).

Stats page has feature like seeing no. of matches someone played, runs, average, strike rate etc. and similar counerparts related to a bowler also.

I used Javascript for fetching data from API.
